== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the look and feel of the Button? =

Visit the Settings->OnlyWire tab in your Wordpress admin tool.  You will see the ability to customize the look and feel of your Button - colors, fonts, sizes, etc...

= Is this free? =

Yes, to use OnlyWire's service is absolutely free as long as you sign up for an account at OnlyWire.com and submit the URL of your website so we can validate the Button is installed correctly.  OnlyWire charges a small monthly fee for publishers and bloggers who do NOT wish to utilize the Button on their site.  OnlyWire employs talented engineers and designers to build and maintain the service therefore we have to make money either through site advertising or monthly subscription fees.

= What makes OnlyWire better than AddThis.com or ShareThis.com? =

OnlyWire is the only service which auto-submits content to multiple sites simultaneously.  AddThis and ShareThis only allow readers to submit to one site at a time.  OnlyWire has built this submission technology from the ground up, and we are constantly making improvements to streamline the process for users wordwide.  Hundreds of thousands of bloggers and publishers depend on OnlyWire to drive traffic and syndicate content.
